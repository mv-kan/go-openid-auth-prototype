# OpenID Auth Prototype

This is prototype project purpose of which is to create simple auth server, client and protected resources using OpenID Connect. It is terrible and in general this project is for me

## Note

`openid-provider` - `auth server (give access tokens)`

`relying-party` - `client (browser)`

`resource-server` - `protected resource (requires access token to give permission to resource)`
